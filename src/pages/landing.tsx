                Hi there! I'm Oliver Nederal, currently a high school student
                just like you. School can be tough, and sometimes online
                resources and YouTube aren't exactly of help. That's where peer
                support comes inâ€”working together makes learning more fun and
                effective! Being a student myself, I understand the challenges
                of balancing assignments, tests, and extracurriculars.
              </p>
              <p>
                I put my sweat, blood, and tears into making StudyBuds with the
                belief that no one should feel lost or alone in their studies.
                By connecting with others, we can all improve, grow, and
                succeed.
              </p>
              <p>
                To do this, education has to be accessible. I, personally,
                pledge that StudyBuds will always be free to use, and will rely
                on charitable donations to solely cover the operations cost of
                hosting it.
